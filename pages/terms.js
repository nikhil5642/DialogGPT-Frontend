				email and password. It's crucial to provide accurate and up-to-date
				information during registration. Failure to do so, or providing

				responsibility, and you should inform us immediately if you suspect any
				unauthorized access or security breaches. Please avoid using someone
				else's name or any trademarked names as your username without proper
				authorization. Also, refrain from using inappropriate or offensive
				usernames.

				By creating an Account, Users may opt to receive newsletters and other
				promotional materials from DialogGPT.io.
